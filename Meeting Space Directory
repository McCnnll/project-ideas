I just saw that the [Texas Reliability Entity offers its meeting space to non-profit groups](http://texasre.org/StakeholderOutreach/announcements/Pages/TexasREAnnouncementNewTexasREConferenceCenterAvailableforWorkshopsandEvents.aspx). It wouldn't be very convenient for Open Austin, but that knowledge and the suggestion at the March meetup that Open Austin have a hackathon in the Capitol building led me to think it would be a useful resource for Open Austin to offer a directory of government buildings that allow non-profits to meet there.
